# Chess Project - Junior Design Final Project
Project utilizing the python-chess & pygame libraries.

Allows you to upload PGN files of games you would like to study, and tests your recognition skills. Users can upload a minimum of 3 games, and games cannot be miniatures (<= 20 moves). The program will select a random middlegame position from one of the uploaded PGN files, and you must correctly identify the players of the game. After that, you will be asked to identify the next move in the position, with white or black to move being specified.
